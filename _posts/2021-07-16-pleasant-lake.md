<div class="boldgrid-section"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-12 col-xs-12 col-sm-12">In Pleasant Lake, Indiana we met Charlie and Sharon, who are hosts and travel enthusiasts on Boondockers Welcome. BW is an annual subscription service that grants you access to a community of people who offer their property up for travelers to stay short term. The camping spots are either free or at a low cost based on utility use. If you offer your property as a host, you get half off the annual subscription. It’s a pretty sweet deal!

Our first night was fantastic! They helped us park, showed us where the electricity was, introduced us to their dog, Abby, and after we chat for a while they let us walk Sawyer around their backyard, which happened to be on a gorgeous lake! It was very safe, we slept great, and when we were heading off in the morning Charlie brought out cookies that Sharon had wanted us to take. (Which we ate before breakfast and they were delicious!) We’re very grateful to have come across this community and are excited for many more adventures that it enables us to have! Maybe someday if we get some land we can pay it forward.
