We got an early start the next morning, bid Charlie and Sharon farewell, and drove straight through Indiana to Starved Rock State Park in Illinois. This was a bit of a detour. Instead of hugging the Lake Michigan coastline and driving through Chicago we shot past the city and would take a direct turn North after the park.

State Parks are great in general, but this one was spectacular! It was made up of a network of trails perched alongside the Illinois river. The park was made of sandstone which takes ages on the geologic time scale to erode when left untouched, and that’s what formed the beautiful canyons, gorges, waterfalls, and rock formations throughout. However, when visited by 2.5 million people every year, just by walking across the sandstone with our feet we could make the park unrecognizable in 100 years or less. The clever solution to this was to build the miles and miles trails into treetop walkways!

We saw Starved Rock, French Canyon, Lover’s Leap, and Eagle Cliff. Along the way were informational signs about the local wildlife and Potawatomi, Peoria, and Fox Native American history.
