<div class="boldgrid-section"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-12 col-xs-12 col-sm-12">Upon arriving in Wall, SD, I was astounded to realize that the hundreds of Wall Drug store billboard signs that had hugged the highway for 650 miles had all been entirely hand-painted. That was a serious marketing effort! We didn’t think we’d swing by but after seeing rolling grasslands adorned with signs exclusively for Wall Drug is was almost like we were hypnotized into going there. We had to see what all that had been about. Signs for everything from 5 cent coffee to a dinosaur park, jackalopes to South Dakota sourced gold jewelry.

Wall Drug confused us at first because we were expecting an enormous building surrounded by a water park and assorted other attractions. What we found was that it made up an entire strip of downtown Wall and styled as an old-timey saloon slash tourist area. Over the past 90 years since Wall Drug opened I guess it just absorbed the whole street! You walk into the cafe and gift shop and behind it is a labyrinth, with indoor and outdoor sections, of all the sign advertisements accounted for.

It was a hoppin’ place and we didn’t want to take Sawyer inside so we took turns running through it getting food and doing some quick exploring. It had everything except what you would find at an actual drug store!

Well-equipped for the evening, we headed south just a few miles from town to our first boondocking location on public land- right outside Badlands National Park.
