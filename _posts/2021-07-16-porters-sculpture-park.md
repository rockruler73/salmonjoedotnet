Who knew a straight, flat, hot road could have so much to look at! Blue Mounds is in the southwest corner of Minnesota and we soon found ourselves across the border. My original plan was to take Joe and Sawyer to a dog-friendly delicatessen in the middle of Sioux Falls that morning, but after traveling with the camper this far and knowing how stressful it can be to drive through a city, and find a place to park we opted against it. For the best! We stayed on I-90 for a bit until we spotted a roadside attraction that we did not want to miss.

<div class="wp-video" style="width: 640px;"><video class="wp-video-shortcode" controls="controls" height="360" id="video-34-2" preload="metadata" width="640"><source src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MVI_2303.mp4?_=2" type="video/mp4"></source></video></div>Over the horizon loomed a 60-foot Egyptian bull head sculpture, I kid you not, along with about fifty other welded art pieces large and small. We pulled off the highway and onto a short dirt road that wrapped around the front side of the park. This was my first memorable experience with a cattle grate, which, for those of you like me, it’s a short strip of metal bars over a ditch that you drive over. It befuddles cattle and they can’t cross it so they’re put across roads with enough traffic that you don’t want to put a gate. Driving over them is loud and it’s silly but it startled me and I looked at the thing and thought… That is the most useless drainage ditch I’ve ever seen. Now it makes sense though, and we’ve seen them everywhere from camp roads to highway ramps.

When we pulled up to the sculpture park we met the artist himself, Wayne Porter. He had learned welding from his father and made the trade into his own personal art form. We paid the $10 per person entrance fee and it was like Joe, Sawyer and I had walked right into Wayne’s creative mind. Many of the sculptures were accompanied by poems that I found to have moving insight regarding the human experience, our cultures, and our minds. Some pieces were simple and sweet, others dark and twisted, and still others were enormous and elaborate. What a strange and lovely experience that was. Just one guy doing what he loves and putting it out there, not for profit or recognition, but to share his thoughts for strangers to explore and enjoy.
