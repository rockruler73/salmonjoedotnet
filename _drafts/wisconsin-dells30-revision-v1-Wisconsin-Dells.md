We ended up missing our exit and I’m glad we did. Backtracking through Dells we were surprised to find that it looked like a little Vegas tucked in the middle of Wisconsin. There were riverboat tours, a Ripley’s Believe It or Not!, a multitude of watering holes that surely made for a lively night scene, and a nearby state park were just the first things we noticed on our brief drive through! Who would’ve thought?

Our stay was in a quieter part of town with \_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_. They had a beautiful barn bedecked with lights and a collection of picnic tables where they hosted visiting travelers. They were very friendly- starting to see a trend! We had a nice conversation about Vermont and what our week had been like so far before they bid us a good evening. We had a few extra minutes to get organized before sunset and by the time we were ready for bed a luminous moon had risen over the barn. We’d been keeping quite busy and it was a nice reminder to take in the moment and appreciate how lucky we are.

The next morning we used our Camp Chef stove for the first time on the trip and enjoyed coffee and breakfast at one of their picnic tables before shoving off.
