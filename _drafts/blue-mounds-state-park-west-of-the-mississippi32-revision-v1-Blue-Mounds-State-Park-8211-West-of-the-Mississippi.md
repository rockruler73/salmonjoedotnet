It took us a few minutes but we realized that this was actually a momentous occasion: we were West of the Mississippi! It was an exciting feeling to think that the landscape might start rapidly changing. To that point, we could definitely see farther than in Vermont or the Adirondacks, but it was still largely lush green forests and farmland. Our destination that evening: Blue Mounds State Park. It’s known for the herd of wild American Bison who roam the prairie adjacent to the park.

We arrived at the park in the late afternoon with hours of daylight on our hands! To this point, our schedule had been quite aggressive and left us little time in the morning or evenings to rest. We got the best campsite in the whole place, closest to the waterfall and furthest from neighbors- who were, when we chatted with anyone walking by, of course incredibly friendly.

Blue Mounds has a network of trails that you can walk or bike that takes you alongside the prairie, so we thought, let’s go on a run and go see some Bison! It turns out that the herd actually has over a thousand acres to roam and often times were many mounds away and out of sight. We jogged around and checked out the observation decks but no dice. The June heatwave that was blistering much of the country had caught up to us at that point so we didn’t care to push it. Would we have loved to a wild Bison herd? Absolutely! But that’s the thing about wild animals, they can go wherever they want, and we’re happy that’s the case.
