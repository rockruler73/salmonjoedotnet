<div class="boldgrid-section"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-12 col-xs-12 col-sm-12">Boondocking on public lands for the first time went great! Our battery was mysteriously malfunctioning up until this point in the trip so we didn’t have our water pump or lights, but even without it’s just so nice having a sturdy roof, comfortable bed, and all of our food and clothes with us at all times. The wind did rock us around that night, which I noticed, decided it was benign, and immediately fell asleep. It bothered Joe considerably more but we got some good rest regardless.

We were deciding whether or not we wanted to push on toward our destination or lockdown our camper somewhere and take the scenic route through the National Park. We were nervous, this was the first time we’d leave the camper entirely unattended for hours, but one look out our door and the decision was practically made for us. We couldn’t stop at the edge, we had to dive in and see the park while we had the chance. After all, if I were in the thieving business I certainly wouldn’t go through the hassle of popping up someone’s camper on the side of the road and wading through their few, and at that point, fairly unorganized collection of belongings to find something of great value. I’d go to some mansion with tons of stuff with owners living at one of their other mansions. So, with that solid logic, we made the leap, locked it down, and left the camper on a pull-off right next by where we slept.

We swung by Wall for the last time and Joe and Sawyer changed the oil while I scrounged up a high-calorie and very tasty breakfast. Then, drove back past our camper in waiting and in just minutes found ourselves at the entrance to the National Park. We purchased the annual park pass with great excitement, anticipating all of the things we might see in the upcoming year, and started our drive along the Badlands Scenic Byway.
