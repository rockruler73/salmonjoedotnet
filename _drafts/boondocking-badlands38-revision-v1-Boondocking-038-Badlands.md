We pulled onto a dirt road and ascended a small hill toward a cliff side boondocking area that we found on the Buffalo Gap National Grassland and Google Maps. We pulled up to the edge and the sight took our breath away. It was our first up-close introduction to the singular landscape of the Badlands (less than three miles from our site) and it looked like a slice of Mars had fallen from space and nestled itself into a grassy hillside.  
Dotting the winding cliff side were a collection of fellow boondocking campers. We took the very first spot available! We’d been keeping an eye on the weather to watch a storm that was blowing towards us from the Black Hills. We’d also heard that two years ago somebody’s rig had flown right off the cliff and tumbled down into the ravines (nobody was in it, thankfully). I didn’t think we’d have a single problem, it was completely calm when we arrived, but to be safe we angled our A-frame adjacent and far away from the edge so there would be no accidental lift-off. Good thing we did because not long afterward, we were taking Sawyer for a walk along the dirt road, and out of nowhere- I wish I’d watched it coming toward us across the grassland- a sturdy gust of wind pushed away that stillness and it didn’t let up until the following day.

While Joe and Sawyer set up camp, I ran into town and grabbed some quesadillas and Coronas. I got back as the sun was starting to sink low in the sky and as we watched the storm blow in that was accompanying that wind. We stayed ready to move the camper to a lower spot if we thought it necessary, but the wind was still less than half the speed of what it was when that other rig took its unfortunate tumble.

The storm ended up splitting down the middle and missing us entirely, but we could see so far in all directions that we didn’t miss out on the spectacle of it. To the East, the striated cliffs, to the South, dark clouds with flashing lightning, and to the West, the magenta setting sun with a purple rainstorm falling in between. And then there was us, perfectly dry, in the middle of it all. I will never forget it.

Sawyer didn’t want everything to go perfectly though, the mischievous pooch that he is. As we sipped our last beers of the evening we thought it would be nice to let him off leash for the first time since leaving New York. He got a good case of the zoomies and tore around, happening across a nice pile of poop, and decided he’d love to make a snack of it. Gobbling it down with great efficiency despite our immediate and intense scolding, he later settled himself onto the cliff side between us and we ended the romantic evening with him belching into the breeze. Another thing I surely will never forget.
